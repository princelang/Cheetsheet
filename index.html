    <h1>CSS Selector and Combinators Cheet Sheet</h1>
    <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
    <p>CSS selectors are used to define a pattern of the elements that you want to select for applying a set of CSS rules on the selected elements. Combinators define the relationship between the selectors. Using various selectors and combinators, you can precisely select and style the desired elements based on their type, attributes, state, or relationship to other elements.</p>

    <h3>Types of Selectors</h3>
    <p>There are over 80 selectors and combinators. CSS selectors can be grouped into the following categories based on the type of elements they can select.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Selector</th>

    <h2>CSS combinators</h2>
    <p>A complex selector is a sequence of one or more simple and/or compound selectors that are separated by combinators, including the white space which is a descendant combinator.</p>
